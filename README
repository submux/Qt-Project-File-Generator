This is a simple program written in the period of about half an hour to
scan a directory for source and header files so that a simple QMake .pro
file can be generated to simplify editing of a project.

It theoretically can be extended to be more functional, even for the sake
of compiling the applications scanned, but at least for the moment, I didn't
see any point to this. In most cases build systems are so complex that
automatically generating them is not practical.

Please feel free to use this code however you might wish. I didn't bother
taking the time to make it a nice clean project with separate header and source
files as it was trivial enough that it simply wasn't worth it.

To use the program, simply compile it and run it with the name of the project
file you'd like to produce. The program will generate the proper relative
paths for the .pro file. Probably to get all the symbols working, it'll be
necessary to add a few INCLUDEPATH += statements.
